Current Modlist.

MINIMUM requirements: 12g memory, Some sort of launcher like MultiMC or Prism, and patience.

MultiMC: https://multimc.org/
Prism:   https://prismlauncher.org/

The pack is currently using Minecraft 1.20.1 with Java 17.0.8 x64bit and Forge 47.3.25.

There is no ETA, no set modlist, and nothing tested serverwise. Things are being done in stages
currently, we are at the "Adding, subtracting, setting up everything" phase. The pack runs 
surprisingly well SSP but has not been tested SMP yet.

Server Machine Stats: i9-12900KS with 64g of DDR4 mem. Storage is 1tb SSD, The pipeline is 2Gps.
As we continue this journey, a domain name will be purchased to streamline and make connecting
much easier.

This pack is not public domain and is made for the sole use of "The Ominous Dark" gaming group.
The server will be invite only and no tech-support will be offered in getting the pack running
or with individual issues. Combisekt wants to enjoy the pack, not spend all the time offering
tech support. Major issues and crashes will be addressed by the staff.

A Discord has been set up as well for the server.
